From Ray to Z.

Nothing's okay.
Wuntch Circling me like a shark frenzied by chum.
The task force, turning into a career-threatening quagmire.
An internal affairs investigation casting doubt upon my integrity.
And you ask, \say{is everything okay?}
I am buffeted by the winds of my foes' enmity and cast about by the towering waves of cruel fate.
Yet I, a captain, am no longer able to command my vessel, my precinct, from my customary helm, my office.
And you ask, \say{is everything okay?}
I've worked the better part of my years on earth overcoming every prejudice and fighting for the position I hold.
And now I feel it being ripped from my grasp.
And with it the very essence of what defines me as a man.
And you ask, \say{is everything okay?}
